2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer
our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and
to comply with law. We may also process your information for other
purposes with your consent.
We process your personal information for a variety of reasons,

manage user accounts. We may process your information so you
can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account
in working order.
To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process
your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s
vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO
PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under
applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect
your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.
If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us
to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
your personal information:
Consent. We may process your information if you have given us
permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a
specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn
more about withdrawing your consent.
Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we
believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such
as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as
evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe
it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
of any person.
In legal terms, we are generally the 'data controller' under European data
protection laws of the personal information described in this Privacy Notice,
since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we
perform. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the personal information we
process as a 'data processor' on behalf of our customers. In those
situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we
have entered into a data processing agreement is the 'data controller'
responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your
information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want
to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read their
privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.
If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
(i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied
consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
law to process your information without your consent, including, for
example:
If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
cannot be obtained in a timely way
For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
with next of kin
If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
or may be victim of financial abuse
If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or
a province
If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
purposes for which the information was produced
If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
regulations
4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION?
In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this
section and/or with the following third parties.
We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
business to another company.
5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
TECHNOLOGIES?
In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect

technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help

use their technology to provide advertising about products and services
tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on
other websites.
Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can
refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyse
the use of the Services. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your thirdTermly
party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where

from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may
vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often
include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
platform.
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on
the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice
to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United

period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have
an account with us.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information,
or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
is possible.
10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM
MINORS?
In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
under 18 years of age.

18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By
using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are
the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from
our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
children under age 18, please contact us at __________.

12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has
been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
revised version of this Privacy Notice.
